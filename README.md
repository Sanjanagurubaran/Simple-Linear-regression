LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL -INSTRUCTIONS

This is a prediction model based on simple linear regression . This model showcases linear relationship between temperature and icecreamsales. It also shows how precisely the system  predicts the value based on testdataset.

Libraries used here are:

1.Numpy library for easy usage of array

2.Matplot library for graphical representation of linear regression

3.Sklearn library for showcasing linear regresssion

The actual value is marked as * in red colour and the predicted value is marked in blue colour to show the precision
